# STM32F3-SPI
SPI standard for STM32F3 with HAL library on IAR, the project is created by STM32CubeMX.

This is the code for SPI testing on STM32F334C8 using HAL library in KeilC or IAR for ARM. My folders only contain the source code and you can regenerate the whole programming files by running the ".ioc" files on STm32CubeMX. All of the peripheral setups can be found in the ".ioc" files. The code can be easily comprehenced by reading the user code sections in the "main.c".
